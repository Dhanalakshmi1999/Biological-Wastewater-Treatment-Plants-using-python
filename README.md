Abstract
The paper presents the importance and the necessity to increase the efficiency of cleaning process of
the residual waters from waste industry. There are presented the methods of treatment of the residual
wastewaters, in order to find the best condition and parameters treatment process.
Key words: wastewater, sludge, process, reactor, toxicity factors, biomass
INTRODUCTION
The concepts of sustainable development suppose solving the problems which
appear in a present activity, so that, not to appear negatively aspects of that in the future. It
was created, generally, of late, the opinion that, wastewater meaning environmental
destroys especially surface and underground water and because of this has to be treated.
The indispensable element of our entity, water is so daily present so as to
considering always conveniently and indispensable.
Of course, is only an opinion!
Even that has the big quality permanently to regenerate, water resource of Terra
and – especially – from our country aren’t not far so big as to justify an inadvertent
management.
Even that the Blue Planet disposes of 1, 4 billions km 3 of water we have to keep in
mind that only cca. 1% of this quantity is containing in surface water.
The Romania water consumes is cca. 20 billions m 3 /year; a part of the used water
is returned in mainstreams, but, through impurities contain contribution, this fact
determined sometimes pollution of these.
The waste water contributes in a sizable measure to such as negatively aspect.
To these wastewaters resulted from landfill are added water from industries and all
of them are discharged, finally, in mainstreams.
These short presentations of this situation make – consider – in vain any
supplementary argumentation of necessity of efficiently treatment of waste water, the
problem which people with a long time ago realized and try to solve them through different
treatment process, and, of course, before like these water was discharge in mainstreams.
